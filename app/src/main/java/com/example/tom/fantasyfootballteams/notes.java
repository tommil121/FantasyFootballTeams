    I want to be able to have the applicaiton use the team_id rather than the team name in the
    player table because the way we have it set up now could cause errors. This will require a decent
    amount of work. I will do it, but not until we start our next sprint. Everything works for me as
    of 11/5/15

    I want the delete player method to be called upon team deletion.
